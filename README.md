# Totient mult. demon.
**$\phi(xy) = \phi(x)\phi(y) $**
## Example
<p>Let's start with an example with 2 simple primes. The example looks stupid but it's easily formalyzable and works for every pair of primes.<br>
$2*5 = 10$ <br>
$\phi(10) = \phi(2)\phi(5) = 4$ <br>
$\phi(5) = 4 = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ <br>
$\phi(2) = 1 = \{1\}$ <br>
